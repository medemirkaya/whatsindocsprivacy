# Privacy Policy for Whats In Docs

**Last Updated:** November 2025

Whats In Docs ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Google Chrome Extension collects, uses, and safeguards your information.

## 1. Information We Collect

### a. Google User Data
We access your Google Docs and Google Drive data solely to provide the core functionality of the extension (analyzing revision history). This includes:
*   Document content and metadata.
*   Revision history and changelogs.
*   User names associated with document edits.

### b. Authentication Data
We use your Google Account to authenticate your identity via Google's official OAuth 2.0 service. We do not store your password.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

*   **To Analyze Writing:** We process document data to calculate writing statistics, visualize revision history, and detect paste events.
*   **To Display Replays:** We use the data to reconstruct the document creation process in the "Watch Replay" view.

## 3. Data Storage and Processing

*   **Local Processing:** All analysis and processing of your document data occur **locally** within your browser.
*   **No Remote Servers:** We do **not** send your document content, revision history, or personal information to any external servers.
*   **Local Storage:** Analysis results are stored in your browser's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`) to improve performance and allow offline access. You can clear this data at any time by clearing your browser's extension data.

## 4. Data Sharing

We do **not** sell, trade, or otherwise transfer your personal information to outside parties. Your data remains on your device and within the Google ecosystem (Google Drive/Docs).

## 5. Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions for specific purposes:
*   `identity`: To authenticate with Google Drive.
